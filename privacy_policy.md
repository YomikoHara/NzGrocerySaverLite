**Last Updated: July 12, 2025**

NzGrocerySaverLite is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we do - and more importantly, do **not** - collect, and how your data is handled when you use the app.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

NzGrocerySaverLite is designed with your privacy in mind. We **do not collect, store, or share** any personal or sensitive information. Specifically, the app does **not** collect:

- Your name, email address, or any other identifying information  
- Your location, IP address, or device identifiers (other than what is required for standard internet communication and advertising purposes)  
- Usage analytics, behavior tracking, or diagnostic data beyond what is necessary for displaying ads  

You can use the app fully without creating an account or providing any personal data.

## 2. Internet Access

NzGrocerySaverLite requires internet access **solely** to retrieve up-to-date grocery pricing information and to serve advertisements.  
No user-specific data is transmitted, logged, or shared with our own servers.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This app integrates with third-party services, including Google AdMob, to display advertisements. These services may collect information such as:  

- Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)  
- Approximate location (if enabled on your device)  
- App usage data for ad personalization and analytics  

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle your data:  

- [Google AdMob Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device's privacy settings.

You can control how Google uses your data for personalized ads by adjusting your device settings:

- On Android, go to **Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization**.
- On iOS: **Settings → Privacy → Tracking → Disable “Allow Apps to Request to Track” or adjust app-specific permissions**.
- For more details, visit [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

Note: Disabling personalized ads does not remove ads from the app but will make them less relevant.

## 4. App Tracking Transparency (iOS)
In compliance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, iOS users will be prompted to grant or deny permission for tracking. Tracking is only used for delivering more relevant advertisements. Declining tracking does not affect your ability to use the app.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or to comply with legal requirements.  
Any updates will be published here with a revised "Last Updated" date.  
By continuing to use the app after changes are made, you agree to the updated policy.
